# Follow-Up Action Plan

This plan outlines prioritized tasks to improve the Play Buni Platform codebase based on the initial codebase analysis report.

## 1. Immediate Tasks
1. **Install Dependencies**
   - Use `pip install -r backend/requirements.txt` to install all Python dependencies.
2. **Configure Environment**
   - Copy `backend/env.example` to `backend/.env` and update values for your local setup.
3. **Run Tests**
   - Execute `pytest` from the project root to verify the environment.

## 2. Medium-Term Improvements
1. **Create Automated Test Suite**
   - Implement unit and integration tests for routers and services with `pytest` and `pytest-asyncio`.
   - Aim for 80%+ code coverage.
2. **Continuous Integration**
   - Set up a CI workflow (GitHub Actions) to run tests and linting on each pull request.
3. **Improve Documentation**
   - Add docstrings for all modules and usage examples in the README or docs folder.

## 3. Long-Term Goals
1. **Architecture Enhancements**
   - Evaluate breaking large services into smaller modules or microservices.
   - Implement rate limiting and strengthen authentication.
2. **Monitoring and Performance**
   - Integrate Sentry for error tracking and add metrics collection for Celery tasks and database queries.
3. **Dependency Maintenance**
   - Periodically audit and update packages in `backend/requirements.txt`.

## 4. Documentation Updates
- Expand the README with clear developer setup instructions, including running tests.
- Maintain a `CHANGELOG.md` for tracking major changes and releases.
